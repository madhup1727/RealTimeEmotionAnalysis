# RealTimeEmotionAnalysis

Because of lack of data that can forewarn medical emergencies/crisis,  timely medical help may not reach a person in need. Moreover certain research/study may need to observe humans in their natural environment, without disrupting their day to day activities, so that correct treatment/help may be provided. This is where our solution will help bridge the gap.
